            <p>
              Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work with
              renowned companies such as Amazon, Evolution, Airbaltic, and
              Reserved. These experiences have allowed me to develop a
              comprehensive understanding of various sectors, including retail,
              service, logistics, and entertainment. In each role, I have
              contributed to the success of the organizations by fulfilling
              responsibilities that were vital to their operations
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              To further enhance my skills and stay up to date with industry
              trends, I have pursued additional training at Riga Coding School.
              This experience has expanded my technical capabilities and
              deepened my understanding of coding practices and methodologies. I
              possess a strong command of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (JS),
              enabling me to develop and enhance web applications and
              interfaces. These technical skills, coupled with my industry
              knowledge, have equipped me to tackle challenges effectively and
              deliver results.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              As an individual, I am known for my patient and detail-oriented
              approach to work. I take pride in my ability to meticulously
              analyze and solve problems, ensuring that every aspect is
              thoroughly addressed. Moreover, I am equally comfortable working
              independently or as part of a team, adapting to different
              collaborative environments seamlessly.
